# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game developed in C as a first-year programming project. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid, aiming to be the first to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

## Getting Started

To run the game, clone the repository and execute `Game.exe`. Please note that this game is designed to work on Windows operating systems only.

## How to Play

1. Run `Game.exe`.
2. The game will prompt Player 1 to enter their move by selecting a number corresponding to an empty space on the board.
3. Player 2 will then take their turn in a similar manner.
4. Play continues until one player gets three marks in a row, column, or diagonal, or the board is filled with no winner, resulting in a draw.

Enjoy playing Tic-Tac-Toe!
