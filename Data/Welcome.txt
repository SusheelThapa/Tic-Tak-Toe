                                        TIC TAC TOE


Hello Chief, this is your assistant, J.A.R.V.I.S.  Some people, however, prefer to call me Agent T for professional purpose.
You probably have already heard of or played the game of Tic Tac Toe in real life with pencil and paper. 

But since that causes futile waste of paper, pencil which in turn results to  environmental pressure and your precious time to process each step,we have come up with this idea of Tic Tac Toe game on the computer. 

If you think this game does not require much of knowledge to develop and play then well, it has tested our creators' brain to develop me and this game and now it is time to test your brain against your friend. How about challenging your friend for a (1 v 1) Tic Tac Toe match

Here's a quick tip before entering into the match, always think one step ahead of your competitor. Think of it like this, what would you do if you were in his/her position? This guarantees you a decent chance of drawing, if not winning it. Don't be discouraged if you draw or lose, pick yourself up, dust yourself off and say, "How about another match?"

Alright, Agent T signing off, enjoy your stay!
