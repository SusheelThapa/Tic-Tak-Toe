TWO PLAYER MODE:

Basically, we need just three function for the logic of game

    board() --> to display the tic tak toe board
    check() --> to check if one has win 
    data() --> To store the record of the game

Other helpful function

    welcome() --> Just greet the user whi run the program
    rules() --> show a set of rules than must be follow to play the game    


FUNCTION EXPLANATION:

    board( positon, user)
        ~This take two argument that take postion and user who choose that position

        This function will update the character array and then display it 


    check() 
        This function will check who have win the game

    data()
        This functionw will write data to the files
        Data can be :   
            Player Name
            Date they have played
            Time when they have play
            Time taken by them to play that game
            Who have won the game




EXPLANATION

    let,
        user one = X
        user two = O

    We will create global character arrray of 2d of rows and columns 3 * 3 and value of all the element of character array will be a space i.e ' '

    Creating array:
        ~Declare character array of 3 * 3
        ~Initialize array with all element as space i.e ' '
            --> Use double for loop to do that 


    Postition in TIC_TAK_TOE GAME:
            NW | NN | NE 
            --------------
            CW | CC | CE
            --------------
            SW | SS | SE 


    Sample Board:

        After call, with postion NE and hit by user 1
            i.e board(NE,user 1)

        If should display as :

                |   | X
            ------------
                |   |   
            ------------
                |   |   


    Check() should evalute array and return 1 if user 1 win, 2 if user 2 wins and 0 that no one has win

              X |   | X
            ------------
                | X | O 
            ------------
              O |   | X

            Above should return 1 as X mean user 1

    We will discuss what should be written in data then we will implement the data function 


    Dear Teammates,
        I am not good at english so, someone implement welcome and rules function. We will later on discuss rules


    Out of three function choose one and work on it.

    If any difficulty then just ask 

    Remember to write algorithm and make flowchart for every function you write

    For flowchart,

OUTLINE OF program

    while 
    {
        calling board function
        taking input
        upadting board
        check if anyone has wins
    }

    When anyone had wons

    calling data function to store the data in a files


Above is the main logic if any improvemented need in logic just msg in chat 

Later on we will add other things also ..
